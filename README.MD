# META-HUMAN DATABASE

## OVERVIEW

- an application to help you keep track of who's who in the world of super-powered individuals.

- Written in Angular 4.

- Tested using the Jasmine framework, with Protractor for end-to-end tests and Karma for unit tests.  

## ISSUES

- Angular 4 not being a mature iteration has hindered me quite a bit. Specific info is hard to find or there is very little of it once I find any. I expected this but was hoping the sparse amount of information wouldn't hold me back as much as it has.
